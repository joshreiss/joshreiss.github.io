        <p>I am a Professor with the Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London, where I lead the audio engineering research team. I have published over 150 peer-reviewed papers, including over 40 in premier academic journals. I am co-author of the textbook Audio Effects: Theory, Implementation and Application. From 2013-15, I was a governor of the Audio Engineering Society, a leading professional organization with over 14,000 members. I am a Royal Academy of Engineering Enterprise Fellow and have extensive experience commercializing research. I frequently consult with companies in the audio space, or others in need of audio-related expertise.</p>
        <p>I have served as an expert witness in major cases related to audio technology and patent litigation.</p>
        <p>I am co-founder of four high-tech spin-out companies. LandR, who provide intelligent and automatic online music production services, Waveshaper, who deliver intelligent AI-based audio effects, RoEx, who provide AI music mixing services and most recently, Nemisindo, offering sound design services based around innovative procedural audio technology.</p>
        <p>The audio engineering research team explores a wide range of topics in music production, psychoacoustics, sound synthesis, digital audio effects, audio signal processing and related subjects. A major focus of our work is concerned with the development of intelligent signal processing for sound engineering, to assist both amateurs and professionals in the technical aspects of audio production.</p>
