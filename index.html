      <p>I am a Professor with the <a href="https://www.c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/">Centre for Digital Music</a> at <a href="https://qmul.ac.uk/">Queen Mary University of London</a>, where I lead the intelligent sound engineering research team. I have published over 150 peer-reviewed papers, including over 40 in premier academic journals. I am co-author of the textbook Audio Effects: Theory, Implementation and Application. 
        I am a Fellow and former President of the <a href="https://aes2.org/">Audio Engineering Society</a>, the leading professional society dedicated to supporting the field of audio engineering and its allied arts. 
        I am a Royal Academy of Engineering Enterprise Fellow and have extensive experience commercializing research. I frequently consult with companies in the audio space, or others in need of audio-related expertise.</p>
      <p>I have served as an expert witness in major cases related to audio technology and patent litigation.</p>
      <p>I am co-founder of four high-tech spin-out companies. LandR, who provide intelligent and automatic online music production services, Waveshaper, who deliver intelligent AI-based audio effects, RoEx, who provide AI music mixing services and most recently, Nemisindo, offering sound design services based around innovative procedural audio technology.</p>
      <p>The audio engineering research team explores a wide range of topics in music production, psychoacoustics, sound synthesis, digital audio effects, audio signal processing and related subjects. A major focus of our work is concerned with the development of intelligent signal processing for sound engineering, to assist both amateurs and professionals in the technical aspects of audio production.</p>

        <p>My research is focused on the application of state-of-the-art signal processing techniques in order to enable improved recording, mixing, mastering   and playback of digital music. Recent projects have included work on automatic mixing, microphone artifact prevention, real-time video-synchronised time scaling and pitch shifting, digital parametric equaliser design, intelligent dynamic range compression and transient modification. My research interests include</p>
